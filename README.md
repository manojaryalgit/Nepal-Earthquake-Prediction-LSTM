# Nepal Earthquake Prediction using LSTM

This project applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict earthquake occurrences in Nepal based on historical seismic data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and transformation of earthquake data.
- **LSTM Model**: Implementation of deep learning techniques for time-series forecasting.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Analysis using MAE, MSE, and R2 Score.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of predictions vs actual data.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NepalLSTM.git
   cd NepalLSTM
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook NepalLSTM.ipynb
```

## Dataset

The dataset consists of historical earthquake records in Nepal, including features like latitude, longitude, depth, magnitude, and timestamp.

## Model Architecture

- **LSTM Layers**
- **Dense Output Layer**
- **Dropout Regularization**

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-Squared Score (R2 Score)**

## Results

The model successfully predicts trends in earthquake occurrences with reasonable accuracy.
